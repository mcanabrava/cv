        <p> <em> Business Analyst at Red Ventures Brazil </em> </p>
        <sp><em> Tech student for fun </em> </sp>
        <p> I am an INTJ/ENTJ with a generalist background in business management
          and experiences in consultancy, M&A, and the education industry.
          Lately, I've been looking forward to learning more about tech,
          as I understand this combined knowledge can help me see and seize opportunities
          for breaking the frontiers of what is possible today. </p>

        <p>Through my work, I hope to contribute to the decision of big local or global challenges and to improve people's lives. Enjoying the journey with a great team and building meaningful relationships are also important to me. After all, what would
          life be like if there were no people in this world? </p>
